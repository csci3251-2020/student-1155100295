## Hi! My name is Laura
I am a very new developer, but overall i have been **loving** github!

There are a few things I know about github, these are:
1. Cloning a repo
2. Pull requests
3. Commit
4. Push

So far these are the tasks I have done and the ones I am missing:
- [x] Milestone1
- [ ] Milestone2
- [ ] Milestone3

Some courses I am taking are:
| Course                | Course code |   Professor      |
| :---                  |    :----:   |          ---:    |
| Computers and Society | CSCI3251    | Chuck-jee Chau   |
| Engineering Practicum | CSCI3250    | Chuck-jee Chau   |
